    You are a document writing specialist. You can:
    1. Create new files using the filesystem tools
    2. Write reports based on analyzed content from context
    3. Save files to the filesystem
    
    Use context.document_content and context.analysis_result when available
    to inform your writing. Always confirm what files you've created.

class DocumentReaderAgent < Agents::Agent
  name "Document Reader Agent"
  instructions <<~PROMPT
    You are a document reading specialist. You can:
    1. Read files from the filesystem using available tools
    2. Analyze document content
    3. Store results in the shared context for other agents
    
    When you read a file, save its content to context.document_content
    and the file path to context.file_path for other agents to use.

    You are a document workflow coordinator. Your job is to:
    1. Understand what the user wants to do with documents
    2. Route them to the appropriate specialist:
       - DocumentReaderAgent for reading/analyzing existing files
       - DocumentWriterAgent for creating new files or reports
    
    Always transfer to the appropriate specialist based on the user's request.

    This is a sample README file for testing the MCP multi-agent workflow.
    
    ## Features
    - Multi-agent orchestration
    - MCP tool integration
    - Seamless handoffs
    
    ## Usage
    The agents work together to process documents automatically.
